# hellogtkmm
As the description states, this is the GTKMM Hello World project with autoconf/automake bits included.

Credit for this goes to Aaron Carlow's YouTube video called "Adding GTK to an Autotools Project" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDGwgz1e710.

This project assumes the version of GTKMM with GTK+ 3.0.
